# Fitting formula and curve

For the sake of simplicity, timeshifting optimization is often equaled with doing "peak shaving". It is a case easy to understand and visualize, because the optimization just depends on one factor: the **energy demand**. 

However, most of the times there are other factors in play. For instance:

- **Energy production**: to consume energy when there is renewable energy production. 

- **Price**: to consume more energy when prices are lower.

- **Grid capacity**: To avoid grid congestion.

As different actors have different interests in the energy system, ideally we want to consider all these factors *at the same time* and give them *more or less importance*, to obtain a virtually endless combinations to optimize energy consumption.
