Note how: 
- Giving all the importance to the *Demand* produces the typical "peak shaving" profile. 
- The *grid capacity* is not constant; instead, the flexible demand adapts to its variable pattern. 
- Setting *Demand*, *Production* and *Price* to zero, it is visible at the right end of `comparison` the portion of flexible demand that wasn't allocated because its time window exceeds the end of the timeseries.
