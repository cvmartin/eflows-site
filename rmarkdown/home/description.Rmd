## What is `eflows`?

`eflows` is a framework for managing energy management systems (EMS) data and apply functions over it.

It is also a reflection of the ideas of the author in matter of sustainable energy systems, and how to actually make it happen. This website shows not only examples of what `eflows` does, but also describe the theoretical foundations of it. 

The functions used, as well as their underlying algorithms, are integral part of the framework. Depending on if they involve steering or not, these can be:

- **Descriptive**: They help to predict how the energy flows in an energy system will look like in the "baseline" scenario (no steering involved). `simulate()` and `distribute()` are examples of this. 

- **Prescriptive**: Are based around the idea of *timeshifting energy demand*. The energy is consumed in a delayed way (`foreshift()`) or before and stored (`backshift()`), so the moment of consumption

`eflows` *is not* an EMS. It can be used as the "core" of the EMS, and then additional infrastructure depending on the EMS elements can be used to:

- A way to gather real-time data from devices and other data sources (like weather forecasts) to use as inputs for `eflows`.

- A way to relay the instructions to the devices to steer in some direction, using the results of `eflows`.

## Getting started

To install 


To get started, visit:
- Design principles: Describe the theoretical undestanding of eflows and the internals. 
- foreshift: start here if you want to get a grasp
- fitting curve: a theoretical and practical essay of how to decide how to timeshift energy demand
- Electric Vehicles: user case of how to manage vehicles. the first user case. 





## Future developments

- develop `backshift()`
- include a function `timeshift()`, that does `foreshift()` and `backshift()` at the same time.

`eflows` can be used in several contexts:

- **Interactive analysis**: Use `eflows` in the console or within short R scripts to explore different scenarios.

- **Real-time steering**: Embed `eflows` in a web infrastructure, and benefit of its speed to indicate to devices what to do. 

- **Dashboarding and visualization**: The speed of `eflows` allow to integrate it within shiny framework (like in this website).
