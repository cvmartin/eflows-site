eflows is based on a number of functions, two of which involve timeshifting the energy demand:

- `foreshift()` : If energy would be consumed in the present moment, consume it instead in the future. It involves devices whose energy consumption can be delayed, for instance electric vehicles. 

- `backshift()`: If energy would be consumed in the future, counsume it instead in the present moment. It involves devices that allow for energy storage. This includes batteries, and also heat pumps with a heat buffer.

Note how the foreshifting and backshifting of demand roughly tanslates in the two main strategies used in the catch-all term "demand-side management": Either by regulating the time the demand is consumed (foreshift), or by using batteries at strategic moments (backshift). The proposed terms *foreshift* and *backshift* just highlight what happens to the electricity, as it is *timsehifted*.

> Future development of `eflows` include a function `timeshift()`, that does `foreshift()` and `backshift()` at the same time.
