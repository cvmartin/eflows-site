### Estimating EV flexibility in districts and cities

As the number of EVs increase, it is possible to take adavantage of the "law of big numbers" in order to estimate the potential for flexibility at district and city scale. 

Here it is necessary to play with statistical models, that try to predict the average demand of EV charging over a whole area, depending on a number of factors (for instance, the hour of the day and the day of the week). More precisely, the objective is not only to predict the total demand, but also know what proportion of such demand could be delayed how much over time. 

The resulting profile can be then foreshifted, to have an estimation of how the energy flows may look like. As any estimation, it has to be taken with a grain of salt, and its accuracy depends on the first place on the accuracy of the estimations regarding the demand necessary for the EV charging.
