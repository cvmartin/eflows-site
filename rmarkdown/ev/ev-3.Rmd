### Integrating EV flexibility at large scale

If several EV users charge their cars in a predictable way (each one of them with a similar demand, at more or less the same hour), a pattern starts to emerge. Integrating data of enough EV charging sessions produces a pattern with *predictive power*: it informs about the EV demand that will happen in the future. 

If the data used include the flexibility of the EVs demand, it is possible to plan in advance how the demand of the EVs can be foreshifted for a better use of the grid. This includes the possibility of integrating EV demand with predictions of household consumption.
