# Electric Vehicle charging

Electric vehicles are one of the main cases for the application of eflows, and particularly the foreshifting of demand. 

Normally, the optimization of car charging comes in two flavors: 

- Charge a certain amount of energy within a timeframe, allocating the charge in the moments when it is the most beneficial.

- Charge as fast as possible given a certain available power, and distribute the charging load in the best possible way among cars. 

## Optimize allocation of energy within a timeframe

Normally electric vehicle charging looks like this:

But we want to make it look like this:

### Making use of the *large numbers*: estimating the congestion in districts and cities

## Optimize distribution of power

## A combined approach
