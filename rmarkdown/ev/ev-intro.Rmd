# Electric Vehicle charging

Electric vehicles (EVs) are one of the first cases for the application of eflows; they are a "low hanging fruit" when managing the demand side management of the EMS. 

The optimization is done by commanding either the EV or the charging pole to charge at a given power, or to halt the charge if appropiate. The optimization of the charge comes in two varieties, depending on the objective: 

- Charge a certain amount of energy within a timeframe, allocating the charge in the moments when it is the most beneficial.

- Charge as fast as possible given a certain available power, and distribute the charging load in the best possible way among cars. 

eflows considers both cases. The first one makes use of `foresehift()`, while the second uses `distribute()`


## Optimize allocation of energy within a timeframe

Particularly, are an example of foreshifting where the demand is *punctual* in time. 



Normally electric vehicle charging looks like this:

But we want to make it look like this:

### Making use of the *large numbers*: estimating the congestion in districts and cities

## Optimize distribution of power

## A combined approach
