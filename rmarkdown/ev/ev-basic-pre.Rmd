The `original` tab shows the would-be demand of the EV in the "business as usual" scenario. There is no distinction between different levels of flexibility, and the moment when the EV starts charging is irrelevant. The profile of consumption only depends on the total demand and the maximum charge rate. 

`foreshifted` shows each portion of the EV demand allocated in time to achieve "peak shaving", distinguishing demand with 2 (near-instant demand), 6 and 12 hours of flexibility. Multiple cases can be defined changing these different demands.
