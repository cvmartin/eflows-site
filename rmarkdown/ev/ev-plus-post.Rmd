Note how:

- The profile of a given EV (as seen on the tab `aggregated by ev`) depends not only on its preferences, but also on the preferences of the rest of EVs.  

- The tab `unstacked` is essentially the plan of the charging power profile that should be sent to each charging point in order to realize the optimization.
