Note how:

- The `foreshifted` profile is different depending on the charging start time: during a peak of demand, the higher flexibility tends to be foreshifted; this is not the case if the charging starts during the night.   

- The "peak shaving" effect is more notorious in tab `comparison` as the demand is more flexible and the maximum charge power is higher.
