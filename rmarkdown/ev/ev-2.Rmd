### Integrating the preferences of several EVs

A couple of significant improvements can be made from the live example above:

- The optimization should be able to integrate the deadlines and demand requirements of two or more EVs. As described in [foreshift](.#foreshift), this is achieved using a list of flexible matrices, one per EV,

- The optimization should be done to follow any criterion, not only peak shaving. This is achieved customizing the [fitting formula](.#fitting).
