### Integrating the preferences of several EVs

A couple of significant improvements can be made from here:

- The optimization should be able to integrate the deadlines and demand requirements of two or more EVs. As described in `foreshift()`[LINK], this is achieved using a list of `flex_mtx` objects, one per EV,

- The optimization should be able to foreshift the EV demand following other objectives besides peak shaving. This is achieved customizing the fitting formula [LINK].
