## Optimize distribution of power

In this modality, the objective is to distribute a given amount of power among several charging EVs. In case the demand overpasses the power available, the power shall be distribute accordingly between EVS, following a preference. 

This is achieved by using `distribute()`. This allows to consider the different user options. 

Ideally, the algorithm use adapts the consumption within the time constrains and the power requirements:
