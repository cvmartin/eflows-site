Note how:

- In the tab `original` and without household demand (*Number of households* = 0) the peak of demand with *District type* "Late night charging" is higher than with the "Residential" one. However, considering the demand of hundred households, the peak of demand is higher in the "Residential" scenario. This is because the EV demand of the "Late night charging" scenario conveniently happens when household demand is low.
