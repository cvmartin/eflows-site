`distribute()` allows to consider a good number of  user cases. The default EVs have different parameters to reflect this: 

1. A user with a large battery half-full `soc = 40, vol = 75`, charges at high rate `cap = 20`, the owner is not in a hurry to charge `level = 1` (The higher *level*, the earlier the EV charges).
2. Average car almost full `soc = 40, vol = 50, cap = 12`; the user is a doctor, and must have the battery filled as soon as possible `level = 3`. 
3. Small utilitarian for daily commutes `soc = 15, vol = 30, cap = 10`; the owner pays less in exchange for lower charging priority `level = 0`.
4. Average car with the battery almost empty `soc = 5, vol = 50, cap = 12`. The user is going on a long trip soon, so has higher priority `level = 2`.
5. Taxi driver, the battery is quite full `soc = 30, vol = 40` but is convenient to have it complete `level = 2`; the EV can charge at a faster rate `cap = 20`.

Try to change the parameters to simulate your own user scenarios.
