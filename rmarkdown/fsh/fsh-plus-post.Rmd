Note how: 
- The layers with lower flexibility tend to "stand in place", while the ones with higher flexibility tend to displace more and "fill the gaps".

- This is reflected in the tab `unstacked by flex`, that show the individual profile of each flexibility. The higher variations are always found in layers with higher flexibility.
