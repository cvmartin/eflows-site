The graph below is a representation of energy consumption over time. The fixed demand is blue, and there is a uniform green layer of flexible demand that can be shifted to the future a certain number of hours. The objective is to do "peak shaving".

Try to modify the flexible layer; both in its volume and its amount of flexibility.  

To appreciate the changes, switch between the tabs over the graph:
- **original**: How the energy profile looks like before passing through `foreshift()`.
- **foreshifted**: The result after the application of `foreshift()`.
- **comparison**: Quick comparison of the total demand of both profiles.
