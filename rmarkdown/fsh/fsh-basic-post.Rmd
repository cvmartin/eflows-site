Note how: 
- The lower the flexibility of the flexible layer, the more it resembles to the original demand. When the flexibility is `1`, it is identical (a flexibility of `0` may sound intuitive, but it doesn't work; it would mean that has to be dispatched in zero timesteps).
- With high flexibility and enough flexible volume, the total demand "flattens out"; the peaks and valleys of consumption dissapear.
