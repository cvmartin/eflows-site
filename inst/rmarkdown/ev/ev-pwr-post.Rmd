Note how:

- The profiles look like when all the EVs have the same `level`. Compare when each EV has assigned a different `level`. 
- A *Random capacity* profile often causes EVs to charge at variable rates. 
- The `y` axis of the lower graph is expressed in terms of power (kW), to fit with the units of *Grid capacity*. Because the timestep is one minute, to express it in terms of energy (kWh) would just require to divide it by 60.
