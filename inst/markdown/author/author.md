`eflows` is developed through the involvement with <a href="https://resourcefully.nl/" target="_blank">Resourcefully</a>, an energy transition consulting firm based in Amsterdam. `eflows` has been already used to simulate the local effects of a variable number of electric vehicles and PV installations at local scale.
